# Reverse Polish Notation

Mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands.

## How to run?

Copy this repository using following command:
```
$ git copy https://github.com/artur-guniewicz/Reverse_Polish_Notation.git
```

In ```source_code``` package find ```projekt.cpp``` file. Than build and run.

Example:
```
g++ projekt.cpp -o projekt && ./projekt
```
Condition! All 4 files must be in the same folder!

## Files:
* calculateRPN.cpp - calculates the value of an expression stored in RNP
* convertToRPN.cpp - conversion of traditional notation to RPN
* klasaStos.cpp - Stack implementation
* projekt.cpp - main file
* RPN_project.pdf - pdf file contains task, source codes, explenations, comments, results, instructions, graphics, screens and more (in PL)

*** The program contains errors control, but deliberately it can be suspended. That is why I would ask for exercise program commands and entering valid expressions. ***
